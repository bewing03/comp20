# Status Report #1

## Issues
* Soundcloud and Spotify API's require application registration that could take up to a month to complete so we are unsure they would be approved in time for the final submission. We are going to change to using the background of the game being the Google Maps streetview of your current location

## Accomplished
* Created index.html that displays "Loud Farm" in body  
* Created server.js   
* Created package.json file for dependencies  
* Began to find animal images  
* Added sign in form (signin.html & signin.css)

## Goals
* Setup database  
* Make animals show up on Google Maps  

#Comments by Ming
* Don't focus too much on login as it is a red herring problem  (many better options than to do it yourself)
